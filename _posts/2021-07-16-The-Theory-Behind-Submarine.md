**A** submarine is a vehicle that moves forward after overcoming hundreds of obstacles on the dark bottom of the deep sea. But you know what? How does Sabrin work? How did it start, and what is the life of the soldiers inside it? Today we will see the beginning and end of all this.

Just as a submarine can float on the deep bottom of the ocean, it can also float on the sea. It has many uses. Since the depth of the sea can be determined with it, submarines are also used for research and exploration of the sea. There is no pair of subs to attack the enemy. Nowadays, it is elementary to find hidden enemies with the advanced technology of submarines. It is known that attempts were made to build underwater vehicles many centuries ago. But he failed. Cornelius Drebel was the first naval officer under King James I of England in 1620.



Successfully discovered the submarine. Drebel's sub was made of wood, and the whole hero was wrapped in leather so that water could not enter. This submarine had to be driven standing. The drivers inside had a few separate tubes or tubes to supply oxygen. They floated on the water. This submarine could go up to three to four feet deep in the water.


 Over time, subs have been connected to the use of advanced technology. Today's submarines can go up to about four and a half thousand feet deep. Advanced technology is used for navigation on the water and deep underwater. It relies heavily on the ballast tank theory of the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes. Archimedes' approach is: Submerging an object in water will remove water equal to its volume. This means that if the submerged thing is lighter than the weight of the water removed, it may be floating.

  **Let me give you an example,**
  <br>if you fill an empty plastic bottle with air and leave it in water, the bottle will remain floating. If you fill it with water again, the bottle will become heavy and sink. Submarines are controlled following this formula. 
  
  
  The sub has some ballast tankers. Water and air are injected inside the tankers with the help of the device. When the hero needs to be sunk, the water in the ballast tanker is injected. Whenever it needs to be floated again, the water from the ballast tanker is taken out, and the air is quickly injected with the device's help. As a result, the submarine floated on the water.
  
  
   The propeller behind the submarine is used to move forward. This propeller rotates the submarine forward at a speed of 50 to 60 meters per hour. But the sea Nothing can be seen in the frozen darkness of the bottom. So a three-dimensional picture of the environment in front of the submarine is drawn by throwing sound waves from the gold room. This technology allows the sub to be controlled from the control room in the middle of the submarine.
   
   
   The essential thing in a submarine is the use of oxygen. With the help of oxygen generator technology, oxygen is supplied to it, and the carbon dioxide produced by respiration is expelled out of the submarine through the soda lime process. The life of the soldiers in the sub is complicated.When they go to the deep sea, they have no contact with the outside world. They can't see the sunlight as long as they are in the submarine, and they can't take a bath. They wear a special kind of shirt and pants as an alternative to bathing, containing bacteria and fungicides. Again after three days, They took out a set of new clothes and pants and fell. The soldiers of the submarine have been eating rice bread and less spicy curry for a long time. There is no opportunity to eat anything else while on the sub.
   
   
   The inside of the submarine is crammed with parts. So there are very few places to sleep. In a small cabin, it is tough for the soldiers to sleep with 5-6 people. Get a mean of five to six hours of sleep.
   
   
   The soldiers in the submarine are always on alert. Because a little bit of a mistake can lead to a fatal accident, however, they accepted the hardships of being in a submarine with a smile only for the country's sake. We are proud of those soldiers. Constant respect for them.
