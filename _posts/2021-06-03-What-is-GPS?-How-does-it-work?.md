GPS is one of the most life-changing technologies of the modern age. We are all more or less familiar with GPS. Suppose you have forgotten a completely unknown place. You can't find a trustworthy person to ask you where you are and how to get home because many people have trouble in unfamiliar places. In this case, G, P, S is the lamp of Ala-Din for you! With GPS tracking, you can discover your method to the right place.

## What is G, P, S? And its history:
GPS is an acronym for 'Global Positioning System.' It is a special kind of technology through which the navigation unit of mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc., can be found or found very simply. The U.S. Department of Defense, like the Internet, gave rise to GPS. The GPS originated in the United States in the early 1970s. As far as history goes, the U.S. military started the initial work of GPS technology for its own needs in 1986. Although in the beginning, just military work was passed down. It was later opened to the public. Created in 1995 by a combination of 24 satellites, The S-Network was announced as a self-contained system for use from all over the world and was made available to the public. By then, this network had become strong enough.

How does GPS work?
GPS is controlled by 27 satellites and GPS receivers. Of which 24 are active, and 3 are reserve. These 26 receivers are the prime part of it. There are 24 satellites in 7 orbits 20,000 km above the Earth's surface. That goes around the Earth twice in 24 hours. The orbits are managed in such a way that at least three or four satellites are visible from anywhere on Earth at any one time. The satellites are constantly sending two types of signals, L 1 and L 2. These signals come at the speed of light, that is, at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second. And every indicator has a timeout written on it. Now the question is, How these signals are received and processed by the GPS receiver. The GPS receiver calculates the runtime by subtracting the sending time from the receiving time of the indicator. Multiplying 300,000 by runtime gives the distance of the satellite from the receiver. Thus finding the range of the four satellites, the receiver focuses on the position of each satellite, drawing four three-dimensional circles along the radius of each length. Then determine the position of the circles by 3-D trilateration calculation with the intersection point. Problems understanding? Let's discuss: Suppose your mobile or P, C has a GPS receiver fitted. This receiver will try to establish as much connection as possible with the satellite if you need it. Each satellite has an atomic clock attached to it. The receiver synchronizes the pseudo-random code transmitted from the satellite and updates its clock, meaning that the clock current of both the satellite and the receiver becomes the same. The more the GPS receiver can communicate with the satellite, the more information it can give you. When your mobile or GPS unit can communicate with at least three satellites, it will be capable of easily determining your correct position.. Much like this, "I am Mr.' X'" "My position is 'Y'" and "Z" when sending this information. GPS software or GPS maps for roads, petrol pumps, police stations, hotels-restaurants, tourist spots, Contains information from department stores, etc. When GPS is on, it displays on the display of the GPS device if there is anything mentioned around the current position. And holds up to receive signals constantly. GPS is also used to control traffic in cars, ships, planes, big cities, to monitor a particular place on the battlefield, etc. Often, the police or intelligence department can easily monitor the accused or a victim using a GPS and be aware of their movements. Another GPS partner is A-GPS. A-GPS is an acronym for Assisted GPS (A GPS + Assisted GPS). This technology enables GPS to locate devices that have it quickly. The technology for this work takes the help of mobile networks. Intended the mobile tower location, GPS satellites can easily determine the possible location of the device. This means that when your phone searches for GPS signals, A-GPS determines only those satellites around your location through your mobile network.


What is GLONASS?
From World War I to now, in almost all cases, there is competition between the European Union or Russia and the United States! As we already know, GPS is made in the United States. Russia has developed an alternative to GPS technology to compete with the United States. GLONASS. This is a global navigation satellite system. It is also called Galileo. It was begun in 2013. Russia has its navigation system called GLONASS, where the technology is used in space research and military work. However, this technology has not yet become so popular. However, China is also working on a project to build its navigation system called Beidou-2.
Parts of GPS: It can be divided into three different categories, which are as follows:


* Category Search: Refers to satellites about 24 satellites have been distributed on six orbital planes.
* Control Division: This refers to the stations on Earth for satellite maintenance and observation. User category: It refers to the processors of the navigation signals received from the GPS satellite


Appendix:
for location and time calculation. The GPS has played an outstanding role in changing the era. We are constantly using this technology for our needs. And getting a lot of benefits. Whether it is GPS or GLONASS, the purpose of both is the same! So we can use both technologies for our own needs without considering these two technologies as rivals. We will benefit from this.
