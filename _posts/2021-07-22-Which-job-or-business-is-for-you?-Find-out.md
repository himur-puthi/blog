Is it better to have a job or a business? Before you answer this question, tell me, is it better to eat Pizza or Burger? If your answer is pizza, then you need to talk to my little brother once. Because of me, The younger brother stays away from eating by himself. Whenever he sees someone else eating pizza, he starts vomiting. So what is good and what is wrong depends entirely on your tasteâ€”some people like pizza, some people like burgers. In the same way, a job is good for someone, and a business is good for someone. Let's make an unbiased comparison between a job and an industry first of all.

***1.Risk*** If you are proficient in your work. However, even if you lose your job, you will not have a problem getting a job in a new company. But if for some reason, your established business goes bankrupt, you need to get enough speed to rebuild it. Moreover, statistics show that 90% of companies close within three years of starting.

***2.Money*** No matter how skilled you are, you have to wait for a specific year to get a job promotion. But there is no limit to how fast you can make money in business.

***3.Effort*** If you have a job, your work will be limited. That is, you will have to do a limited amount of work. Your work hours and holidays will be fixed every day. But if you want to set up a successful business, your career there will be infinite. That means you have to work endlessly. In this case, neither your work time nor your vacation will be fixed. In the beginning, you may have to work 16 hours 6 days a week.

***4.Freedom*** If Freedom is your business, you can take any leave you want. But in reality, a successful business person cannot accept that vacation because holidays mean business losses or slowdown in work. And a successful businessman never wants to let that happen. On the other hand, if you work, it depends on whether you are free or busy according to the work pressure. And since leave is tied, if you plan to stay for a while, you can get the break you want in most cases.

***5.Responsibility*** The boss has the most responsibility in the company. He is responsible for almost everything. There is an employee's responsibility only to do his job correctly.

***6.Learning*** Learning To build a successful business, you need to learn a thousand things little by little. But to be a good employee, you only need to acquire unimaginable skills in one job.

***7.Security*** Your company may fire you overnight. But a successful business is less likely to go down to zero overnight. Oh, but when it comes to government jobs, the story is reversed.

 So the solution that we can come up with after comparing these seven things is if you prefer limited risk, limited money, limited hard work, limited Freedom, limited liability, limited learning opportunities and limited security where you need to be out of your comfort zone every day. If you don't have to come out and face new problems, then a dear friend or girlfriend business is not for you. Good job for you.
 
 But if you take a lot of risks, a lot of money, a lot of hard work, a lot of Freedom, a lot of responsibility, If you prefer to live an abundant life with lots of learning opportunities and lots of security where every day you have to come out of your comfort zone and deal with new problems then a dear friend or girlfriend job is not for you. Business is good for you.
 
 ***In a word,*** if you are a person of a slightly satisfied nature, then the job is better for you. But business is better for you if you are a man of few minds. Hopefully, I have been able to help you overcome this confusion in your job or business. So the minor request to you. Help your dear friend or girlfriend who is suffering from this same confusion by sharing this article.
